# App introduction
We have campaign page, line-item page and invoice page to list all campaigns, line-items and invoices.
* In campaign page, we show all campaigns in a table with pagination. You can sort the table by name or by total.
Select any campaign and click the top-right "CREATE INVOICE" button to create invoices. You can see an icon next to name to indicate the campaign's invoice has been created. Creating the invoice again will update the invoice data. Each campaign can only have 1 invoice at most.
